My research project entails the further development and implementation
of quantum inspired evolutionary algorithms for large scale optomization 
problems.

I would, of course, like to have this course act as the impetus to gaining
a fundmental and, hopefully, thorough understanding of scientific computing in general.
I would also like to gain enough skill to be able to solve a number of 
mathematics problems, which in doing so, will allow me to simulate and solve a plethora
of physics related problems.
